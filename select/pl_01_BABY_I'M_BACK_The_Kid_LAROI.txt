Baby come back,
any kind of fool could see
There was something
in everything about you
Baby come back,
you can blame it all on me
I was wrong and
I just can't live without you
Baby come back
It's been a crazy last year,
I'm tryna process still
I don't even know
how I should feel
I got a couple big houses
and some whips, maybe three
And I got family members
that got bigger egos than me
And I got fans around the world
whenever I'm overseas
And I got friends who just
pretend and say they love
everything
And yes I fell in love again,
I thought that shit
was impossible
And I promise it's too real
for me to care what they think
I promise I don't give a fuck
because I know who I am
Hatin' on me on the cover,
I just won't understand
Say we're brothers,
call me family, bitch,
ya act like a fan
2 a.m. in Atlanta, screaming,
"Baby, I'm back" (Oh yeah)
Play me like a fool, I see
But it's been too long
since I thought about you
I swear, okay, baby, I'm back
I guess you weren't
the one for me
But it's been too long
since I thought about you
(About you)
I swear, okay, baby, I'm back
I told my baby, "Let them talk,
that's the caption"
I don't even really
like being online,
that shit taxing
Started off as an attraction
Now it's turnin' to attachment
Overseas, we relaxin'
Now you think about
the past tense (No)
'Cause everybody wanna say shit
All the sudden
y'all believed in me
All the sudden
you want a favor now
All the sudden
ya want beef with me
All the sudden
y'all always knew
But I remember
you ain't see it in me
And yes I know I'm blessed
but sometimes I wish
I could go back
To the way it used to be
Just so I can feel
what I been missin'
(Oh, baby come back)
You can have it all, you see
But there's just something
that's not the same about you
(Oh, baby come back)
Baby come back,
any kind of fool could see
There was something
in everything about you
Baby come back,
you can blame it all on me
I was wrong and
I just can't live without you
Baby come back
